# How fast are countries vaccinating?

This is an ETL pipeline to pull daily vaccinations data from [Our World in Data ](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data/vaccinations) and load it into the data warehouse (Google BigQuery). This project aims to show the vaccination progress per country/region.
